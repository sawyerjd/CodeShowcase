I wrote this script to run as a computer startup script via Group Polcy.  It uses a function that used to be in the TechNet Gallery called Search-Registry (full disclosure, I did not write this function, I would give the author credit except I can't find it anymore).  The script searches the registry to see if either a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Firefox is installed.  If it gets a hit, it does some formatting to get the registry key name since every version of Firefox has its version appended to the key name, silently uninstalls that version and finally silently installs an up to date version from a network location.
