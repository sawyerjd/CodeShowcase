This script was made to run as a startup script with Group Polcy.  It removes versions of Wireshark older than 3.0 which contain security vulnerabilities.  It checks to see if Wireshark is installed by checking for the Wireshark key at HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\.  If the key exists, Wireshark is installed so silently uninstall it.  It could also install a newer version but that option wasn't used.  It could also uninstall WinPcap but because there is no way to silently uninstall it, this part didn't work for out situation.
